I am a pathology researcher. Graduating as a medical student, I have been pursuing the field of human pathology since 2019. 


My research and academic interests:


(1) Applying Computer Vision models to extract morphologic features for cancer evaluation and treatment.


(2) Using bioinformatic techniques to find novel biomarkers for risk stratification and targeted therapy.


(3) Developing and refining my diagnostic skills as a hematopathologist since 2019.


I hope to contribute my best, but tiny, effort to the application of AI technology in research and practicing pathology.


I thanks Chad Baldwin for his helpful online instruction to create this Blog.
